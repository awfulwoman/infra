# Project Memory

This file is Claude's shared, persistent project memory. It is committed to
git and visible to all collaborators. Claude reads this at the start of each
session and updates it as new learnings emerge.

Guidelines for Claude when maintaining this file:

- Keep entries concise and factual — no speculation
- Organise by topic, not chronologically
- Remove entries that become stale or incorrect
- Do NOT store secrets, credentials, or personal data here
