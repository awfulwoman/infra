# Python

This project uses python in many places. Therefore ensure that python venvs are installed.

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

At the project level a `requirements.txt` file exists. Ensure everything in it is installed via:

```bash
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```
