# Bastard Technology

Things that I use that are awful, yet I still use them.

## Uncomfortable Dependencies

- Tailscale
  - It's a money making bastard machine. I'd much rather be using plain WireGuard. However I haven't yet come up with a setup that's reliable for use behind my CGNAT home connection.
- Claude Code
  - It's an interface to a massive LLM hosted somewhere in a data centre in the USA. It uses gobbles of energy and drinks water. However, it's hideously useful. No, I'm not proud of myself.
