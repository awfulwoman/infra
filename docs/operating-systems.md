# Operating System

I use Ubuntu on all my hosts. Why?

## ZFS

It's the only distro with ZFS enabled by default.

## Stability with functionality

It's based on Debian - massively renowned as a stable distro. But it adds
on useful extras without compromising that stability.

## Network Effect

It's used so much that it has a ton of documentation and community support.
