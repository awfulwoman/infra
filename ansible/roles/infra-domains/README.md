# Domains

Contains the configuration for the various public domains used in this infra. All the records are public info, which is why they're not encrypted. However some of the domain names themselves are things I'd like to leave behind me, which is why they're encrypted.

A couple of the infra domains are reused internally via split-horizon DNS. You can see more of that in [infra-named](../infra-named).
