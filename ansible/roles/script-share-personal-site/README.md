# Script to share my personal site's repo

This Ansible role takes the self-hosted repo for my [personal site](https://awfulwoman.com) and edits it to make it acceptable for public consumption. It removes the content (there's stuff in there I don't want to share any longer) and replaces it with demo content. It then pushes a the edited and truncated repo (shallow cloned to heck) up to Github.
