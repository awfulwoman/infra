# Home Assistant Configuration Files

For better or worse, Home assistant is normally configured through the UI. But there times when you don't want to do this, such as when you need to include secrets from your IaC repo, if the configuration is not yet possible in the UI, or - most likely - templates need to be built to handle complex situations.

* <configuration.yaml>
* <template.yaml>
* <input_select.yaml> (my first ever "complex" automation, if I recall)
* <secrets.yaml>
