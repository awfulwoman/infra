## Session: Converting Session Logger Agent to Command

**Overview**: Converted the `session-logger` agent to a `/log` slash command, simplifying invocation and improving access to conversation context.

### What Was Done

- **Created new `/log` command** at `.claude/commands/log.md`
  - Adapted all session logging instructions from the agent format
  - Removed YAML frontmatter (not needed for commands)
  - Reformatted content to match the command style used by `/commit`

- **Deleted the session-logger agent** at `.claude/agents/session-logger.md`
  - Agent format was unnecessary for this use case
  - Commands have direct access to conversation history, which is essential for session summarization

- **Updated `.claude/README.md`**
  - Removed `session-logger` from the Agents table
  - Added `/log` to the Commands table with description

### Key Decisions

- **Commands over agents for session logging**: Commands run in the main conversation context with full history access, while agents start fresh and receive a summarized prompt. Session logging fundamentally needs conversation history, making commands the better choice.

- **Simple `/log` naming**: Matches the brevity of `/commit` and is easier to type than the previous `@"session-logger (agent)"` invocation.

### Files Changed

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Created | `.claude/commands/log.md` |
| Deleted | `.claude/agents/session-logger.md` |
| Updated | `.claude/README.md` |

### Current State

The `/log` command is now available and functional (this log entry was created using it). The conversion is complete and ready to commit.

**Structure after changes:**
- Agents: `content-gap-reviewer` (1 remaining)
- Commands: `/commit`, `/log` (2 total)

### Next Steps

- Commit this session log
- Consider whether `content-gap-reviewer` agent should also become a command (likely not - it benefits from running as an isolated subagent)

### Notes

- The trade-off of using a command instead of an agent is that you lose the ability to specify a different model (agents could set `model: sonnet`). However, session logging benefits more from full context awareness than from a specific model choice.

- This change also serves as a practical test of the new `/log` command itself.
