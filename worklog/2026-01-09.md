# 2026-01-09

## Session Overview
Added Hetzner Cloud API credentials to enable infrastructure provisioning.

## What Was Done

- **Added Hetzner API key to vault**
  - Configured Hetzner Cloud API credentials
  - Encrypted with Ansible Vault
  - Enables Terraform to provision Hetzner resources
  - Foundation for infrastructure migration from DigitalOcean

## Key Decisions

1. **Begin Hetzner Cloud integration**
   - Reason: Preparing for multi-cloud or provider migration
   - Impact: Can now provision resources on Hetzner
   - Alternative: Stay with DigitalOcean only (rejected for cost/performance)

## Files Changed

- Vault files with Hetzner API key configuration

## Current State

- ✅ Hetzner API credentials configured
- 🔄 Ready to begin Hetzner resource provisioning

## Next Steps

1. **Add Hetzner SSH keys** for VM access
2. **Update Terraform templates** for Hetzner provider
3. **Test Hetzner VM creation** with new credentials

## Notes

- **Hetzner Cloud**: European cloud provider with competitive pricing and good performance
- **API Key Security**: Stored encrypted in Ansible Vault alongside other cloud credentials
- **Migration Prep**: This is the first step in what becomes a larger Hetzner migration effort in subsequent sessions

## Commits

- `7813c15e` - Add Hetzner API key
